## How to learn

When learning anything, it's better to learn it this way
> These steps apply to all types of resources, whether you're learning by watching, listening or reading

1. **Understand**: Don't follow or do anything with the resources you're learning from, focus only on understanding how to do it and why to do it this way.
2. **Copy**: Go back to the beginning of the resource after you've understood everything and start copying all the steps that were done to acheive whatever the resources is teaching you.
3. **Try**: Check if the end result is the same as shown in the resource, if not go back to step 1.
4. **Experiment**: Now that you have everything setup and working, start experimenting with different ideas of doing the same thing, try changing couple of things or doing it in different ways to make sure that you truly and deeply understand it.
5. **Redo**: Take all your experiments with the resources and put them away and try to redo everything from the beginning by yourself without checking the resource.
6. **Stop**: Take a break after going through all the steps to let your brain process and digest the information it just received, a 10 to 30 minutes break should be enough depending on the level of complexity of the information.
